This is such a rapidly evolving and fascinating area, and I hope my perspective can contribute some useful insights to the ongoing conversations. I\u0026rsquo;m sure there are important aspects I haven\u0026rsquo;t fully captured or considered. I\u0026rsquo;d love to hear your thoughts, questions, and different perspectives during and after the talk! Your feedback and insights would be incredibly valuable in helping me, and all of us, better understand these emerging technologies and their human-centered applications. Looking forward to a great discussion with everyone!🚗🤖 Zoom Meeting Meeting ID: 971 6234 9704\nPasscode: HART26 Please join us!😆\n","date":"February 18, 2026","permalink":"/activities/hart-talk/","summary":" I\u0026rsquo;m excited to share some recent progress in my research at February HART TG Monthly Memebr Conversations I\u0026rsquo;ll be sharing my review work on GenAI techniques in Autonomous Driving HCIs through the lens of Situation Awareness (SA).

Identifying and responding to pilots’ troubleshooting through eye-tracking and Large Language Model In this study, we introduce an innovative approach that tokenizes eye-tracking data into Visual Attention Matrices (VAMs) and integrates them with Large Language Models to identify and respond to pilots\u0026rsquo; troubleshooting activities in real-time. This represents one of the early works combining eye-tracking data with LLMs for adaptive aviation support systems. The method addresses two key challenges: capturing the complex troubleshooting behaviors of actively engaged (In-the-Loop) pilots, and effectively processing non-semantic eye-tracking data using LLM technology.
